        <h2>Key Insights:</h2>
        <p>The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of supplier quality and its correlation with defect rates. It includes various visualizations that offer insights into overall performance, trends over time, and relationships between different metrics.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supplier Quality:</strong> The overall supplier quality score is 82.44, indicating a generally good performance. However, there's a significant range in scores (80.00 to 185.76), suggesting a need for more consistent quality management across suppliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Defect Rate Trend:</strong> The defect rate has fluctuated over the years. Periods of improvement are followed by increases, indicating a need for ongoing quality control to address root causes and maintain consistent performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Supplier Quality vs. Defect Rate:</strong> A general inverse relationship exists between supplier quality and defect rate. As supplier quality increases, defect rates tend to decrease, although the relationship is not perfectly linear.</li>
            <li><strong>Production Metrics:</strong> The production volume and cost have generally increased over time. While no clear correlation with defect rates has been established, further exploration may reveal production's impact on quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance Hours:</strong> Maintenance hours have increased steadily, possibly to support higher production or address equipment issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> The energy consumption has shown a general upward trend, with peaks in 2012 and 2014, requiring further analysis to optimize efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Energy efficiency varies across months, with higher efficiency in January and August, and lower efficiency in April and December.</li>
            <li><strong>Additive Process Time:</strong> Fluctuations in additive process time suggest variations in efficiency and complexity over the analyzed period.</li>
            <li><strong>Additive Material Cost:</strong> Additive material costs follow a similar fluctuation pattern, potentially influenced by factors such as material type and usage patterns.</li>
        </ul>
